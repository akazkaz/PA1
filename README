-------------------------------------------------------------[  DESCRIPTION  ]--

in Pa1 we wrot a code to an interactive program meant to check if an email is in a list of spam addresses
 or not. This program will read in email data files and populate a hash table with these email addresses
, then allow for user interaction with the data. The user will enter email addresses to check if they are
 spam by looking into the hash table.

-----------------------------------------------------------------[  COMPILATION  ]--

Compilation is made easy through the use of the Make utility. A file included
with the source called Makefile specifies how to derive the target program.

To compile the program, simply do the following in a Linux terminal:

	$ make To run the program after make has finished, type the following:

	$ ./spamFilter
in addition to the posibility of using falgs -i -h
-------------------------------------------------------------[ SAMPLE OUTPUT ]--

An example Prompt the short usage message and INVALID_ARGS because the user
 doesn't input the required arguments.

cs30s121ar@pi-cluster-181:~/pa1$ ./spamFilter
Incorrect number of args.

Usage: ./spamFilter {-i dataFile | -h}

cs30s121ar@pi-cluster-181:~/pa1$

an example of The program prompts the user for input and correctly outputs based on that input.
cs30s121ar@pi-cluster-181:~/pa1$ ./spamFilter -i  emails_10
Enter a word: jazz@hack.co
jazz@hack.co is SPAM!
Enter a word: paul@gmail.com
paul@gmail.com is not SPAM!
Enter a word:

an example of Prompt the long usage message because the user input the help flag.
cs30s121ar@pi-cluster-181:~/pa1$ ./spamFilter -h

Usage: ./spamFilter {-i dataFile | -h}
    -i dataFile -- The file containing the data
    -h          -- Displays this long usage message

-------------------------------------------------------------[    TESTING    ]--

I tested my program by comparing its output to the reference spamFilter executable
based on different inputs.

Some specific test cases I tried on the executable:
  * empty string
  * Very small / very large numbers of emails
  * Inputting too few arguments or too many arguments
  

I also ran unit-tests on the function hash(),prependNode(),populateTale() to make sure it properly
squares its input. I tried to hash empty string, string with same hash code, strings with different hash code

Vim Questions
You realized you made a spelling error when using one of the constants from the pa1.h file. Instead of DEFAULT_SIZE, you’ve been typing DEFAUL_SIZE (without the T). How would you find and replace all occurrences of DEFAUL_SIZE in your file to be DEFAULT_SIZE? :%s/DEFAUL_SIZE/DEFAULT_SIZE
