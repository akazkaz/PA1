-------------------------------------------------------------[  DESCRIPTION  ]--

in PA1 we  wrote an interactive program meant to check if an email is in a list of spam addresses
 or not. This program will read in email data files and populate a hash table with these email addresses, 
then allow for user interaction with the data. The user will enter email addresses to check if they
 are spam by looking into the hash table. 
-------------------------------------------------------------[  COMPILATION  ]--

Compilation is made easy through the use of the Make utility. A file included
with the source called Makefile specifies how to derive the target program.

To compile the program, simply do the following in a Linux terminal:

	$ make

To run the program after make has finished, type the following:

	$ ./spamFilter
you can add the two flags -i -h or both of them


	$ ./spamFilter -i -h


-------------------------------------------------------------[ SAMPLE OUTPUT ]--

An example of normal output... (on stdout)

$ ./a.out 1

    Welcome to CSE 30, Spring 2019
    PA0 is due on April 5, 2019
    The square of 1 is 1

An example of abnormal output... (on stderr)

$ ./a.out

    ./a.out: missing integer arg
    Usage: ./a.out [INTEGER]
      Integer value to square

$ ./a.out 1 2 3

    ./a.out: too many arguments
    Usage: ./a.out [INTEGER]
      Integer value to square

-------------------------------------------------------------[    TESTING    ]--

I tested my program by comparing its output to the reference pa0test executable
based on different inputs.

Some specific test cases I tried on the executable:
  * Negative numbers
  * Very small / very large numbers to test number parsing range
  * Inputting too few arguments or too many arguments
  * Numbers with non-digit characters, e.g. 123xyz456

I also ran unit-tests on the function squareNum() to make sure it properly
squares its input. I tried zero, positive, and negative numbers.

-------------------------------------------------------------[   QUESTIONS   ]--
Vim Questions
You realized you made a spelling error when using one of the constants from the pa1.h file. Instead of DEFAULT_SIZE, you’ve been typing DEFAUL_SIZE (without the T). How would you find and replace all occurrences of DEFAUL_SIZE in your file to be DEFAULT_SIZE?


Git Questions
What Git command(s) would you use to list files with changes since the last commit? git diff --name-status

What Git command would you use to undo a bad commit that has been already pushed?
What Git command would you use to see the history of all your commits?
Academic Integrity Question
You finished the PA since you started early, but your friend hasn’t and just started working on it even though it’s due tonight at 11:59 pm. Your friend knows you are done with the PA and has asked you to help them so they can finish in time. What do you do to act with integrity?
